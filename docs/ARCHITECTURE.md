# Very-Prince Infrastructure Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the AWS infrastructure provisioned via Terraform for the very-prince backend service and its Next.js static-asset CDN. The infrastructure enables CloudWatch log aggregation, metric alarms, dashboards, SNS alert notifications for an ECS Fargate cluster, global delivery of immutable frontend bundles, and automated lifecycle management for RDS snapshots.

## Terraform State Management

The very-prince Terraform state lives in Amazon S3 and is protected against
concurrent writes by a DynamoDB-backed lock table. The same root module
provisions both resources on the first bootstrap run, then subsequent plans
and applies read/write state remotely with serialized locking.

### Resources

| Resource | Type | Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| State bucket | `aws_s3_bucket` | `very-prince-terraform-state` | Versioning enabled, KMS SSE with bucket key, public access fully blocked |
| Bucket policy | `aws_s3_bucket_policy` | (attached to state bucket) | Denies any `s3:*` action when `aws:SecureTransport = false` |
| Lock table | `aws_dynamodb_table` | `very-prince-terraform-locks` | `PAY_PER_REQUEST`, `LockID` (String) hash key, PITR + SSE enabled |

### Bootstrap workflow (first-time only)

The S3 backend references resources that this same Terraform configuration
creates, so a one-time bootstrap is required before `init` can talk to S3:

1. Comment out the `backend "s3" { ... }` block in `terraform/backend.tf`.
2. From the `terraform/` directory, run:
   - `terraform init -backend=false -input=false`
   - `terraform apply -auto-approve -input=false`
3. Uncomment the backend block in `terraform/backend.tf`.
4. Run the platform-appropriate bootstrap script:
   - **Linux/macOS/WSL**: `scripts/bootstrap-terraform-backend.sh`
   - **Native Windows (PowerShell)**: `scripts/bootstrap-terraform-backend.ps1`

These scripts verify the bucket and DynamoDB table exist, then run
`terraform init -migrate-state -input=false -force-copy` followed by a
`plan`/`apply` cycle with `-lock=true -lock-timeout=300s` to prove that
DynamoDB locking is enforced on every run.

### Locking semantics

- Terraform acquires a lock on the `LockID` row in the DynamoDB table before
  any state read/write.
- Concurrent `terraform apply` invocations fail fast with a lock error
  rather than corrupting the state file.
- Jenkins passes `-lock=true` to every `plan` and `apply`, so the lock is
  always asserted during CI/CD execution.
- Lock TTL is 300 seconds; if a prior run crashed, `terraform force-unlock`
  may be used to release the lock.

### Outputs

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `state_bucket_arn` / `state_bucket_name` | Reference the state S3 bucket |
| `dynamodb_lock_table_name` / `dynamodb_lock_table_arn` | Reference the lock table |
| `state_backend_type` | Returns `"s3"` |
| `state_locking_enabled` | Returns `true` |

## Components

### ECS Cluster (`terraform/modules/ecs-cluster/`)
- Fargate + Fargate Spot capacity providers
- Container Insights enabled for enhanced metrics
- Tagged with Project/Environment

### ECS Service (`terraform/modules/ecs-service/`)
- Task definition with `awslogs` log driver → CloudWatch Logs
- Execution role: CloudWatch Logs write + ECR pull
- Task role: Least-privilege application permissions
- Network: Private subnets + security group
- Optional ALB target group attachment

### CloudWatch Logs (`terraform/modules/cloudwatch-logs/`)
- Log group: `/ecs/very-prince-backend`
- 30-day retention (configurable)
- KMS encryption (AWS-managed)

### CloudWatch Alarms (`terraform/modules/cloudwatch-alarms/`)
- **CPU High**: `CPUUtilization ≥ 80%` for 2 × 60s periods
- **Memory High**: `MemoryUtilization ≥ 80%` for 2 × 60s periods
- Both route to SNS topic for notification

### CloudWatch Dashboard (`terraform/modules/cloudwatch-dashboard/`)
- Cluster CPU/Memory (stacked)
- Service CPU/Memory (lines)
- Task counts (running/pending/desired)
- Log ingestion volume & bytes

### SNS Topics (`terraform/modules/sns-topics/`)
- Topic: `very-prince-shared-critical-alerts`
- Email subscriptions from `alert_email_addresses` variable
- CloudWatch alarm publishing policy

### Asset CDN (`terraform/modules/asset-cdn/`)
- CloudFront distribution using every edge location (`PriceClass_All` by default) to minimize global static-asset latency
- CloudFront Origin Access Control (SigV4) for a private S3 origin; no S3 public access is required
- Bucket policy permits CloudFront read access only to `/_next/static/*` and only from this distribution
- `_next/static/*` uses a dedicated cache policy with a fixed one-year TTL. These paths contain Next.js content-hashed, immutable bundles.
- All other paths use a zero-TTL fallback, so immutable caching cannot be applied accidentally to mutable content.

### RDS Snapshot Lifecycle (`terraform/modules/rds-snapshot-lifecycle/`)
- **Purpose**: prune orphaned manual RDS DB snapshots and DB cluster snapshots that are older than the configured retention period to reduce storage costs.
- **Trigger**: EventBridge rule (`very-prince-shared-prune-schedule`) on the `rds_snapshot_prune_schedule` expression (default `rate(1 day)`).
- **Compute**: Python 3.11 Lambda (`very-prince-shared-prune-snapshots`) that paginates through `DescribeDBSnapshots` and `DescribeDBClusterSnapshots` with `SnapshotType = "manual"`, compares `SnapshotCreateTime` to the retention cutoff, and calls `DeleteDBSnapshot` / `DeleteDBClusterSnapshot`.
- **IAM**: least-privilege inline policy (`rds:DescribeDBSnapshots`, `rds:DescribeDBClusterSnapshots`, `rds:DeleteDBSnapshot`, `rds:DeleteDBClusterSnapshot`) plus CloudWatch Logs permissions.
- **Configuration as code**:
  - `rds_snapshot_retention_days` (default `7`) — days to keep manual snapshots
  - `rds_backup_window` (default `03:00-04:00`) — preferred UTC backup window captured as code
  - `rds_snapshot_prune_schedule` (default `rate(1 day)`) — EventBridge schedule expression for pruning

## Data Flow

1. ECS tasks emit stdout/stderr → `awslogs` driver → CloudWatch Log Group
2. CloudWatch collects ECS CPU/Memory metrics automatically (Container Insights)
3. Alarms evaluate metrics every 60s; trigger SNS on threshold breach
4. SNS delivers to email subscribers (and any HTTPS/Lambda endpoints added manually)
5. Dashboard visualizes all metrics in single pane
6. Browser requests for `/_next/static/*` are served from the nearest CloudFront edge; cache misses are signed and fetched from the private S3 origin.
7. Jenkins builds `packages/backend/Dockerfile` as `very-prince-backend:$BUILD_NUMBER` and scans that exact local image with Trivy before Terraform can apply changes.
8. EventBridge invokes the snapshot pruning Lambda on its configured schedule; the Lambda deletes manual RDS snapshots older than `rds_snapshot_retention_days`.

## Jenkins Pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`)
- Declarative syntax
- Stages: Setup → Build Docker Image → Scan Docker Image → **Init** → **Verify Backend Lock** → Validate → Plan → Apply (gated)
- The image build uses `packages/backend/Dockerfile` and is tagged `very-prince-backend:$BUILD_NUMBER`.
- Trivy runs `trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL` against the compiled image. Any High or Critical CVE makes the scan command return a non-zero status, stopping the pipeline before Terraform apply/deployment.
- OS detection: `isUnix()` → `sh` on Linux, `bat` on Windows. Jenkins agents require native Docker and Trivy CLIs on their `PATH`.
- Artifact: `tfplan` passed between Plan/Apply

## Windows Support
- `scripts/terraform-setup.ps1`: Chocolatey/Scoop/Zip install
- No WSL required
- Jenkins pipeline uses `bat` on Windows agents
- The CDN module uses only the Terraform AWS provider and runs with the native Windows Terraform CLI; WSL is not required.
- The RDS snapshot lifecycle module and its dedicated Jenkinsfile use only native `terraform.exe` / `terraform` commands; WSL is not required.

## CDN Configuration

Set `asset_bucket_name` to the existing private S3 bucket that receives the Next.js build output. Upload immutable bundles beneath `_next/static/`; the module intentionally grants CloudFront access only to that prefix. Use the `cloudfront_distribution_domain_name` Terraform output as the asset host (for example, as the Next.js `assetPrefix` origin) when deploying the frontend.
