# Very-Prince Infrastructure Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the AWS infrastructure provisioned via Terraform for the very-prince backend service and its Next.js static-asset CDN. The infrastructure enables CloudWatch log aggregation, metric alarms, dashboards, SNS alert notifications for an ECS Fargate cluster, and global delivery of immutable frontend bundles.

## Components

### ECS Cluster (`terraform/modules/ecs-cluster/`)
- Fargate + Fargate Spot capacity providers
- Container Insights enabled for enhanced metrics
- Tagged with Project/Environment

### ECS Service (`terraform/modules/ecs-service/`)
- Task definition with `awslogs` log driver → CloudWatch Logs
- Execution role: CloudWatch Logs write + ECR pull
- Task role: Least-privilege application permissions
- Network: Private subnets + security group
- Optional ALB target group attachment

### CloudWatch Logs (`terraform/modules/cloudwatch-logs/`)
- Log group: `/ecs/very-prince-backend`
- 30-day retention (configurable)
- KMS encryption (AWS-managed)

### CloudWatch Alarms (`terraform/modules/cloudwatch-alarms/`)
- **CPU High**: `CPUUtilization ≥ 80%` for 2 × 60s periods
- **Memory High**: `MemoryUtilization ≥ 80%` for 2 × 60s periods
- Both route to SNS topic for notification

### CloudWatch Dashboard (`terraform/modules/cloudwatch-dashboard/`)
- Cluster CPU/Memory (stacked)
- Service CPU/Memory (lines)
- Task counts (running/pending/desired)
- Log ingestion volume & bytes

### SNS Topics (`terraform/modules/sns-topics/`)
- Topic: `very-prince-shared-critical-alerts`
- Email subscriptions from `alert_email_addresses` variable
- CloudWatch alarm publishing policy

### Asset CDN (`terraform/modules/asset-cdn/`)
- CloudFront distribution using every edge location (`PriceClass_All` by default) to minimize global static-asset latency
- CloudFront Origin Access Control (SigV4) for a private S3 origin; no S3 public access is required
- Bucket policy permits CloudFront read access only to `/_next/static/*` and only from this distribution
- `_next/static/*` uses a dedicated cache policy with a fixed one-year TTL. These paths contain Next.js content-hashed, immutable bundles.
- All other paths use a zero-TTL fallback, so immutable caching cannot be applied accidentally to mutable content.

## Data Flow

1. ECS tasks emit stdout/stderr → `awslogs` driver → CloudWatch Log Group
2. CloudWatch collects ECS CPU/Memory metrics automatically (Container Insights)
3. Alarms evaluate metrics every 60s; trigger SNS on threshold breach
4. SNS delivers to email subscribers (and any HTTPS/Lambda endpoints added manually)
5. Dashboard visualizes all metrics in single pane
6. Browser requests for `/_next/static/*` are served from the nearest CloudFront edge; cache misses are signed and fetched from the private S3 origin.
7. Jenkins builds `packages/backend/Dockerfile` as `very-prince-backend:$BUILD_NUMBER` and scans that exact local image with Trivy before Terraform can apply changes.

## Jenkins Pipeline (`Jenkinsfile`)
- Declarative syntax
- Stages: Setup → Build Docker Image → Scan Docker Image → Init → Validate → Plan → Apply (gated)
- The image build uses `packages/backend/Dockerfile` and is tagged `very-prince-backend:$BUILD_NUMBER`.
- Trivy runs `trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL` against the compiled image. Any High or Critical CVE makes the scan command return a non-zero status, stopping the pipeline before Terraform apply/deployment.
- OS detection: `isUnix()` → `sh` on Linux, `bat` on Windows. Jenkins agents require native Docker and Trivy CLIs on their `PATH`.
- Artifact: `tfplan` passed between Plan/Apply

## Windows Support
- `scripts/terraform-setup.ps1`: Chocolatey/Scoop/Zip install
- No WSL required
- Jenkins pipeline uses `bat` on Windows agents
- The CDN module uses only the Terraform AWS provider and runs with the native Windows Terraform CLI; WSL is not required.

## CDN Configuration

Set `asset_bucket_name` to the existing private S3 bucket that receives the Next.js build output. Upload immutable bundles beneath `_next/static/`; the module intentionally grants CloudFront access only to that prefix. Use the `cloudfront_distribution_domain_name` Terraform output as the asset host (for example, as the Next.js `assetPrefix` origin) when deploying the frontend.
